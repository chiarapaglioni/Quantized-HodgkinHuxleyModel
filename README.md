# Quantized-HodgkinHuxleyModel

## Hodgkin Huxley Model

The package **HHModel** provides the implementation of the Quantized Single-Ion and Three-Ion Hodgkin-Huxley Model [1][2].

- Classes `QHH_1.py` and `QSim_1.py` provide the *implementation* and *simulation* of the Single-Ion version of the model respectively [1].
- Classes `QHH_3.py` and `QSim_3.py` provide the *implementation* and *simulation* of the Three-Ion version of the model respectively [2]. 


## Experimental Photonic Quantum Memristor

The package **memristor** provides the implementation of a Experimental photonic quantum memristor [3]. 
In particular, quantum memristors are used in a quantum reservoir computer that solves a classification problem based on the MINST database.

- `main.py` provides the general structure of the quantum reservoir computer.
- The data from the MINST database is encoded in the quantum domain through the class *QEncoder* in `encode.py`. 
- The encoded data is then passed through the quantum reservoir which is composed of quantum memristors. The implementation of the these components can be found in `memristor/utility.py`. 
- Packages `qinfo` and `ucell` provide useful functions for problems in quantum information theory that are used in the previous classes.

## Quantum Memristor

The package **q_memristor** provides the implementation of quantum circuits for memristive devices [4].

- `memristor_1t.py` provides the implementation of a circuit for a single-time-step quantum memristor simulation with three basic steps of initialization, evolution, and the measurement process.
- `memristor_coupled.py` is an extension of the previous circuit as it provides a dynamical simulation where the evolution step is repeated *n* times before the measurement process.
- `memristor_dynamic.py` provides the implementation of a native interaction between two coupled quantum memristors in a digital quantum circuit.
